Landing page project for the Odin project curriculum 
Hello, I am working on another assignment for the Odin Project curriculm. This assingment will be focused on building an entire webpage using what I have learned so far in this course. Wish me luck, I will be using flexbox for this project to see how much I have understood from the previous lessons. Other than that, HTML and CSS will also be the primary focus.
